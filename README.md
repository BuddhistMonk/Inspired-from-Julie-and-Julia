# Inspired-from-Julie-and-Julia
I saw the movie recently "Julie and Julia" and i was inspired not to cook but to complete what i start. So, while going through my kindle account, i found a book which i had bought "Building Machine Learning Systems with Python" and had never read a single page. So, i decided to complete this cook book in 30 days with my own codes!!!
